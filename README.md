# CK3Hack
Modify without paradox knowing.

Pressing "Add new file" when the SearchString and Location are empty clears your selected files for now.

Start before opening the game. Once everything is setup and you press run, the program will freeze until the relevant part of the game has loaded.

By SearchString I mean a string to find in documents/paradox/ck3/logs/debug.log It seems like for CK3 all files can be copied after (CTRL+F) "Authenticated successfully"
